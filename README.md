# QIEDEX – Trust-First Token Creation & Liquidity Platform

QIEDEX is a **free token creator and liquidity platform** built for the QIE blockchain that focuses on **killing scams, rug-pulls, and fake projects by design**with a real world impact.  
Instead of letting anyone create dangerous tokens, QIEDEX enforces **fair launch, locked liquidity, and visible trust signals** from day one.

This project is built for the **QIE Blockchain**.

## How to Run the Project (Using Docker)

```bash
docker run -p 4000:4000 madhesh00/qie-indexer:latest[http://localhost:4000]

## What Problem This Solves

Today in token platforms:
- Anyone can launch a token in 2 clicks
- Devs hide 99% supply
- Liquidity can be removed anytime
- Users can’t tell scams from real projects

Result:
- New users lose money
- Real builders avoid the chain
- The ecosystem stays empty

QIEDEX fixes this **by force, not by trust**.

---

## Workflow Explained (Very Simple)

### Step 1 – Token Creation

User creates a token using QIEDEX’s free creator.

### Step 2 – Fair Launch Enforcement

Creator receives *0 pre-mine*.
Tokens are only obtained by buying or adding liquidity.

### Step 3 – Liquidity Lock

100% of provided liquidity is *automatically locked* for 6–12 months.

### Step 4 – Trust Score Assignment

Token gets a *Green / Yellow / Red* trust label shown publicly.

### Step 5 – Public Trading

Users instantly know whether a token is safe before buying.
